### glib Library
Glibc is the cornerstone of the C standard library for Linux and Unix-like systems, providing the necessary system call wrappers, utility functions, and runtime support that enable programs to interact with the OS and perform essential tasks like I/O, memory management, and threading. It is fundamental to the operation of nearly all software on Linux systems.
